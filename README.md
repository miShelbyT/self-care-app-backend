# Mod 5 Solo Capstone Project: 

Take Care is a self-care/journaling app allows the user to sign up/log in, peruse a list of self-care activities, save, update and delete journal entries pertaining to those activities as well as create original activities. Also uses an external API to view daily affirmations.

App also allows for full CRUD functionality of userâ€™s profile along with encrypted password using BCrypt on the backend and localStorage on the frontend.

* Utilizes localStorage to store encrypted user information client-side
* Implemented Redux to manage state
* Handled serializers on Rails back end to access/manage nested data (including optional belongs_to relationship)
* Used vanilla CSS for all styling including overlays, modals, etc. 

## A HUGE thanks to all of my instructors and coaches at Flatiron for their instruction & support. Also great big shout out to hubby Chris for all the dog walks, coffee, general food/water intake. <3
